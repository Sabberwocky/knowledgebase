Habs mal ausgedünnt. Würde das so morgen hinschicken. Falls du noch feedback hast baue ich es ein

### 1. Development & Release Process

*   **Detailed Release Process:** What does the exact workflow look like from development to the test environment and finally to production deployment?

*   **Code Quality:** Do regular code reviews take place? What is the process for this?

*   **QA (Quality Assurance):** Do you have a dedicated QA team, or how is quality assurance guaranteed?

* **Code Location**: Can you work on an external VCS (our selfhosted gitlab)

### 2. Security & Compliance

*   **Security Pipeline:** Are automated scans performed? How are security vulnerabilities identified and fixed?

*   **Regulations:** Are you familiar with EU laws, the Cyber Resilience Act, NIS 2, and GDPR, ensuring we don't need to conduct extra research?

*   **External Services:** Do you offer access to external service providers, such as for pen-testing or specialized lawyers for compliance checks?

### 3. Operations & Infrastructure on kubernetes cluster

*   **Kubernetes & IaC:** Who maintains the Terraform scripts and Kubernetes config files? Where would you draw the line?

*   **Incident Management:** If there are issues on the cluster, are these also analyzed and fixed by the developers?

### 4. Project Management & Workflow

*   **SLAs & Response Times:** What are the response times for bugs? When can we expect fixes or analyses?

*   **Availability:** Is there an option to have critical issues processed outside of normal business hours?

*   **Agile Methods:** Do you work in sprints?

*   **Meetings:** Are there demos of the implemented features after a sprint? Do retrospectives take place?

### 5. Communication

*   **Point of Contact:** Do we communicate directly with the developers (e.g., in a weekly meeting), or does everything go through a Manager?

### 6. Product Consulting & Experience

*   **Product Development:** How do you proactively contribute? What suggestions do you make regarding feature implementation to ensure the product is better received by the customer?

*   **References & Examples:** Can you provide concrete examples of strategic or product-related suggestions you made to past clients and what the impact was?

*   **Experience:** What was specifically implemented for previous clients in similar situations?
